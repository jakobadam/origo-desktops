RDS-Orchestrator: RDS for the people
====================================

Accessing native Windows apps from anywhere is great but setting up
the `Remote Desktop Services
<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831447.aspx>`_
infrastructure is difficult let alone handling software deployment and
scaling as you go.

Windows Server 2012 R2 provides most of the pieces of a powerful RDS
setup, but the setup is thoroughly cumbersome to get right. It
requires a lot of effort and expertise to stitch together all the
pieces of a working production ready RDS infrastructure. In
addition, you're left in the dark when it comes to rolling out new
software, and handling upgrades.

Things should **not** be like this. We think it should be within a few
clicks on an icon to get your own RDS infrastructure running, software
upgrades should be seamless, and scaling a breeze.
